## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart

### What I learned

For this project I learned how to implement a vertical Bar Chart with ChartJS. I didn't have to included a css file as the API was fairly customizable.

```js
 const labels = jsonData.map((entry) => entry.day);
    const today = new Date().toString().split(" ")[0].toLowerCase();
    const dataset = [{
        label: "Total Spent",
        data: jsonData.map((entry) => entry.amount),
        backgroundColor: jsonData.map((entry) => entry.day === today ? cyan : redOrange),
        borderRadius: 15,
        borderSkipped: false,
    }];
    const data = { labels, datasets: dataset };
    const option = {
        plugins: {
            legend: {
                display: false
            },
        },
        scales: {
            x: {
                grid: {
                    display: false
                },
                border: {
                    display: false
                },
                ticks: {
                    color: lightBrown
                }
            },
            y: {
                grid: {
                    display: false
                },
                ticks: {
                    display: false,
                },
                border: {
                    display: false,
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return (
        <Bar data={data} options={option} />
    )
```
